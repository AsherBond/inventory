/**
 * In Magento 2 Repository considered as an implementation of Facade pattern which provides a simplified interface
 * to a larger body of code responsible for Domain Entity management
 *
 * The main intention is to make API more readable and reduce dependencies of business logic code on the inner workings
 * of a module, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system
 *
 * Along with this such approach helps to segregate two responsibilities:
 * 1. Repository now could be considered as an API - Interface for usage (calling) in the business logic
 * 2. Separate class-commands to which Repository proxies initial call (like, Get Save GetList Delete) could be
 *    considered as SPI - Interfaces that you should extend and implement to customize current behaviour
 *
 * Used fully qualified namespaces in annotations for proper work of WebApi request parser
